# 🌍 Welcome ! 

Climoscope lets you analyze past climate data from the [Copernicus ERA5 global atmospheric reanalysis](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-complete?tab=overview) model.
You can views data from days, month, year, as well as statistics over preset climatic periods. For the moment, Climoscope only has 🌡️ temperature data from 1990 to 2023.

Climoscope is still in active development, 🐛 bugs are expected. Any [feedback](contact) is really appreciated as it helps me to
fix problems and drive future developments.

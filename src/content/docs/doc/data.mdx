## üå°Ô∏è ERA5

[Copernicus/ECMWF ERA5](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview) is a Climate
Reanalysis from 1940 to today. You can find more information on reanalysis on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_reanalysis)
or [Copernicus](https://climate.copernicus.eu/climate-reanalysis), but to put it quickly:

Accurate weather data (notably temperatures, but also wind, precipitations, etc...) has been collected for more than 200 years, first by
individuals, then by armies and ships, then by national meteorological services. Today, we have 100s of thousands of measurements
of the atmosphere every day, but one century ago, the data, though accurate, was much sparser.

A reanalysis infers past data points we don't have. To do this, the reanalysis uses the same atmospheric model we use today for weather
forecast and feeds it with past data over multiple day so the model finds the best atmospheric state fitting available data. Reanalysis
don't invent stuff, they just fill in the blanks.

ERA5 data is made available around 5 days after real-time, then a consolidated version is updated 2 to 3 monhs after real-time. Climoscope
fetches ERA5 data daily for D-7 and D-100.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è GFS

The [Global Forecast Sytem](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/global-forecast) is the U.S. weather forecast model.
It might be a little less good than the european ECMWF model, but it is free, so you will find it used by a lot of services online, including
Climoscope.

The GFS is computed four times a day. Climoscope fetches it four times a day also, around one hour after availability.

GFS "forecast" are also used for the past week on Climoscope, until ERA5 data becomes available. This is not a problem, because the latest
forecast is issued around 6hours before real-time and is usually extremely accurate.

## üìè Geographic precision

Both of these models are used in their version with a lat-lon grid of 0.25 degrees. It means that the distance between two measurement points
might be up to 32km. Local conditions such as [urban heat island (UHI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_heat_island), valleys, or small
islands may not appear on Climoscope.

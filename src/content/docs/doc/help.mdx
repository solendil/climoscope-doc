## Tags

A Tag is a label on the map that displays information at a location. There are three types of tags:

- The **mouse tag** displays full information at the mouse cursor (on devices with a mouse)
- **City tags** display simple information for major cities. Cities appear and disappear according to the map zoom level. You
  can choose the density of displayed cities in the preferences.
- **User tags** display full information at chosen location, they are displayed on a darker background

To set a **user tag**, simply click on the map. To remove it, simply click on it. By clicking on a **city tag**, it can be
converted back and forth to a **user tag** (more detailed information, visible at any zoom level).

On the following picture, Brest and Nantes are **city tags**, Paris is a **user tag** converted from a **city tag**, the tag for Asterix' village
is a **user tag**, and the tag near the mouse pointer is the **mouse tag**.

### Tag text

Tags use symbols for brevity:

- `v` : the current value
- `Î¼` : the value of the [mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean)
- `Ïƒ` : the value of the [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation)

Examples:

<table>
<tr>
<td>
Comparison of temperatures of a year to a period
```
+ 3.3 Â°C
v:12.4Â° Î¼:9.1Â°
```
The temperature this year was +3.3Â°C above period average, the temperature is 12.4Â°C and the average is 9.1Â°C.
</td>
<td>
Comparison (Ïƒ) of rainy days of a month to a period
```
- 2.7 Ïƒ
v:10.0 Î¼:3.5 Ïƒ:2.4
```
The number of rainy days this month was 2.7Ïƒ above the average (which is a [rare event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#Chebyshev's_inequality)), 
It rained 10 days, while the average for this month is 3.5, the standard deviation is 2.4 days. In this case, 2.7 = (Î¼-v)/Ïƒ

## What is ERA5 reanalysis

You can find more information on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_reanalysis) or [Copernicus](https://climate.copernicus.eu/climate-reanalysis)

In the case of Climoscope, I spent a lot of time trying to work with direct station measurements taken from different sources.
However, this information is sparse, and sometimes inconsistent (not by much, but even a 0.1% of erroneous data
can make it very hard to work with).

Using [Copernicus/ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview) leads to
a much more complete and coherent picture. I personnaly assessed that the data from ERA5 is coherent with all the data I had from direct station
measurements, and it is the case. However this comes with its own set of challenges:
the full ERA5 reanalysis weights ~10PB (or 10,000TB or 10 millions of GB)!

## What is ERA5 reanalysis

You can find more information on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_reanalysis) or [Copernicus](https://climate.copernicus.eu/climate-reanalysis)

In the case of Climoscope, I spent a lot of time trying to work with direct station measurements taken from different sources.
However, this information is sparse, and sometimes inconsistent (not by much, but even a 0.1% of erroneous data
can make it very hard to work with).

Using [Copernicus/ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview) leads to
a much more complete and coherent picture. I personnaly assessed that the data from ERA5 is coherent with all the data I had from direct station
measurements, and it is the case. However this comes with its own set of challenges:
the full ERA5 reanalysis weights ~10PB (or 10,000TB or 10 millions of GB)!

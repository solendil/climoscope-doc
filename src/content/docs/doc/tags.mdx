# 🏷️ Tags

<Aside type="caution" title="Note">
  The value of tags may differ from values recorded by local stations. This is
  because Climoscope uses a grid with a precision of around 32km. Local
  conditions such as [urban heat island
  (UHI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_heat_island), valleys, or small
  islands may not be properly recorded.

A Tag is a label on the map that displays information at a location. There are three types of tags:

- The **mouse tag** displays full information at the mouse cursor (on devices with a mouse)
- **City tags** display simple information for major cities. Cities appear and disappear according to the map zoom level. You
  can choose the density of displayed cities in the preferences.
- **User tags** display full information at chosen location, they are displayed on a darker background

To set a user tag, simply **click on the map**. To remove it, simply **click on it**. By clicking on a city tag, it can be
converted back and forth to a user tag (more detailed information, visible at any zoom level).

On the following picture, Brest and Nantes are city tags, Paris is a user tag converted from a city tag, the tag for Asterix' village
is a user tag, and the tag near the mouse pointer (not visible, duh!) is the mouse tag.

### Tag text

Tags use symbols for brevity:

- `Δ` : a delta, or difference between two values
- `μ` : the value of the [mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean)
- `σ` : the value of the [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation)

Examples:

<table>
<tr>
<td>
Comparison of temperatures of a year to a period
> Δ +2.7 °C  
> 11.5° ●︎ μ 8.8°

The temperature this year was +2.7°C above period average, the temperature is 11.5°C and the average is 8.8°C.

</td>
<td>
Comparison (σ) of rainy days of a month to a period
> +2.7 σ  
> 10.0 ●︎ μ 3.5 ●︎ σ 2.4

The number of rainy days this month was 2.7σ above the average (which is a [rare event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#Chebyshev's_inequality)),
It rained 10 days, while the average for this month is 3.5, the standard deviation is 2.4 days. In this case, 2.7 = (μ-v)/σ
